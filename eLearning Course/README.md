The course guides learners through the five key phases of Design Thinking—Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test—while exploring core principles such as human-centered design, rapid prototyping, and iterative development. It includes practical exercises, templates, toolkits, and case studies that demonstrate real-world applications. Assessments and project-based activities are also provided to support skill development and applied learning.

This course is suitable for both beginners and professionals seeking to effectively apply Design Thinking across diverse industries.

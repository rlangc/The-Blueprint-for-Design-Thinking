# 🛠️ Prototyping Approaches Cheat Sheet

**Purpose:**  
This cheat sheet offers a quick reference to various prototyping methods used in the Design Thinking process. Prototyping allows designers to bring ideas to life quickly, test assumptions, and gather user feedback early and often.

## 🔄 What is Prototyping?

Prototyping is the act of creating a simple version of your solution that users can interact with, test, and react to. It helps teams:
- Visualize abstract ideas
- Uncover usability issues
- Validate assumptions before scaling
- Encourage collaboration and iteration

> **💡 Tip:** Prototypes don’t have to be perfect—just useful enough to learn.

## 📊 Types of Prototypes

| Type | Description | Best For | Tools |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **Paper Prototypes** | Hand-drawn interfaces or sketches | Early-stage ideas, UI/UX concepts | Pen + paper, whiteboard |
| **Digital Wireframes** | Low-fidelity screen layouts without visuals | User flows, layout testing | Figma, Adobe XD, Balsamiq |
| **Clickable Mockups** | Interactive version of a UI design | Navigation testing, early demos | Figma, InVision, Marvel |
| **Role-playing / Bodystorming** | Acting out user interactions or scenarios | Service design, empathy building | Props, scripts |
| **Storyboards** | Sequential visuals to show user experience | Journey mapping, storytelling | Canva, StoryboardThat |
| **Physical Models** | Tangible 3D objects or paper-folded interfaces | Product design, tactile feedback | Cardboard, clay, 3D printers |
| **Wizard of Oz** | Manual simulation of tech (e.g., fake chatbot) | Testing behavior before tech is built | Human-led behind the scenes |
| **Code-Based Prototypes** | Functional models with real interaction | Tech feasibility, final testing | HTML/CSS, Python, JavaScript |

## ⚖️ Choosing the Right Prototype

| Goal | Recommended Approach |
|------|----------------------|
| Quickly visualize an idea | Paper prototype, sketch, storyboard |
| Test navigation or flow | Wireframes, clickable mockup |
| Understand user emotion/interaction | Role-play, bodystorming |
| Evaluate physical use | 3D models, low-fi product mockup |
| Test assumptions with real users | Wizard of Oz, interactive simulation |

## 🧪 Best Practices

- **Start low-fidelity** and increase fidelity as you iterate
- **Test early and often** with real users, even if rough
- **Capture feedback** through observation and interviews
- **Avoid attachment**—the prototype is a tool for learning, not perfection
- **Iterate fast**—expect to build, test, and revise multiple times

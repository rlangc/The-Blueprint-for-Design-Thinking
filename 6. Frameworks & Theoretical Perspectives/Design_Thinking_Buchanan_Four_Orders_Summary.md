# 📚 Design Thinking: Buchanan’s Four Orders of Design

**Author:** Richard Buchanan  
**Source:** "Wicked Problems in Design Thinking" (1992)  
**Purpose:** This summary outlines Buchanan’s influential framework describing four distinct yet overlapping “orders” or domains of design. The model provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how design operates across disciplines—from products to systems to experiences.

## 🧭 Overview

Richard Buchanan proposed the **Four Orders of Design** to describe the expanding scope of design practice and its relevance beyond traditional graphic and industrial design. Each order reflects a category of “placement” where design thinking can be applied to address human problems.

## 🧩 The Four Orders

| Order | Domain | Examples | Focus |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| **1st Order** | **Symbols** | Typography, logos, visual identity, signs | Communication |
| **2nd Order** | **Things** | Products, interfaces, physical tools | Material form |
| **3rd Order** | **Actions** | Services, experiences, interaction design | Activities & behavior |
| **4th Order** | **Thoughts/Systems** | Policies, education systems, healthcare models | Social & organizational systems |

## 🔍 Interpretation by Order

### 1️⃣ **First Order: Symbols**
- Concerned with the **visual communication** of meaning through text, imagery, and semiotics.
- Includes design of information, branding, wayfinding, and storytelling.
- Designers act as **communicators**.

### 2️⃣ **Second Order: Things**
- Involves the **design of tangible artifacts**—from chairs to phones to websites.
- Rooted in traditional industrial and product design disciplines.
- Designers act as **makers**.

### 3️⃣ **Third Order: Actions**
- Addresses how people **interact with products, services, or environments**.
- Encompasses user experience (UX), service design, and instructional design.
- Designers act as **facilitators** of behavior and engagement.

### 4️⃣ **Fourth Order: Systems or Thoughts**
- Applies design to **complex systems** like education, government, or health care.
- Emphasizes strategy, systemic thinking, and transformation.
- Designers act as **strategists** and **change agents**.

## 🔁 Relevance to Design Thinking

Buchanan’s model supports the **human-centered and interdisciplinary nature** of Design Thinking:
- It encourages designers to move fluidly between domains.
- It helps frame the **scope of impact** design can have—from micro to macro levels.
- It validates the role of designers in solving “wicked problems” across contexts.

> **Note:** Design problems are often **multi-order**—effective solutions may span symbols, things, actions, and systems simultaneously.

## 🧠 Application Example

A hospital redesign might include:
- **1st Order:** New wayfinding signage for patients  
- **2nd Order:** Redesigned check-in kiosks  
- **3rd Order:** Improved patient intake experience  
- **4th Order:** Organizational change to streamline patient flow and reduce wait times

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- Buchanan’s Four Orders expand the definition of design beyond artifacts to **systems, services, and experiences**.
- Understanding these orders allows for more holistic, contextual, and human-centered design work.
- This framework provides a theoretical foundation that supports **Design Thinking as a transdisciplinary practice**.

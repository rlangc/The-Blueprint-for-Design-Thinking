# Design Thinking: The Five Phases Guide

Design Thinking is a user-centered, iterative methodology that emphasizes empathy, creativity, and experimentation. It is often broken down into five distinct, yet overlapping, phases. This guide provides a practical overview of each stage and how to apply it in real-world contexts.

## 1. Empathize

**Purpose:** Understand users and their needs through observation, engagement, and immersion.

**Activities:**
- Conduct interviews or focus groups
- Shadow users in context
- Create empathy maps
- Review user-generated content

**Outcomes:**
- Insight into user pain points, goals, behaviors
- A deeper emotional connection to the user experience

## 2. Define

**Purpose:** Synthesize research findings into a clear, actionable problem statement.

**Activities:**
- Affinity diagramming
- "How Might We" (HMW) framing
- Persona and journey map alignment
- Insight statements

**Outcomes:**
- A focused design challenge rooted in user insights
- Alignment of team understanding

## 3. Ideate

**Purpose:** Generate a wide array of creative solutions without judgment.

**Activities:**
- Brainstorming and sketching
- SCAMPER or mind mapping
- Crazy 8s and design studio sessions
- Role-playing and co-design

**Outcomes:**
- A rich pool of possible solutions
- Selected ideas to prototype

## 4. Prototype

**Purpose:** Create tangible representations of ideas to explore feasibility and usability.

**Activities:**
- Build low-fidelity paper or digital prototypes
- Mockup user interfaces or service blueprints
- Storyboarding user interactions

**Outcomes:**
- Physical or digital prototypes for testing
- Early-stage validation of concepts

## 5. Test

**Purpose:** Solicit feedback from users to refine solutions and uncover new insights.

**Activities:**
- Usability testing
- A/B testing or scenario walkthroughs
- Capture reactions, questions, and failures

**Outcomes:**
- Insight into how users interact with your prototype
- Data for iteration and improvement

### Iteration Note

Design Thinking is not linearâ€”teams often loop between phases as new insights emerge.

> "Design thinking is not a strict step-by-step process, but rather a flexible, iterative mindset."

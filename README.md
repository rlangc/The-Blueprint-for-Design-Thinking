# What is Design Thinking eLearning Course (Example Coming Soon!)

This repository contains the complete materials for a fully asynchronous eLearning course on Design Thinking. The course introduces learners to a human-centered, iterative problem-solving approach that focuses on understanding user needs, challenging assumptions, and creating innovative solutions through collaboration and experimentation.

Learners will explore the five key phases of Design Thinking: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. The course also covers core principles such as human-centered design, rapid prototyping, and iterative development. Throughout the course, learners will engage with practical exercises, templates, and toolkits designed to apply Design Thinking methods to real-world challenges.

Additionally, the course includes case studies that highlight successful applications of Design Thinking across product design, business strategy, and educational innovation. Assessments and project-based activities are incorporated to reinforce learning outcomes and provide opportunities for hands-on experience.

This asynchronous course is designed to accommodate learners at all levels who want to develop a strong understanding of Design Thinking and learn how to apply it effectively across different industries.

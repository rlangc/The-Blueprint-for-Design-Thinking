# Design Thinking eLearning Course & Archive

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of resources dedicated to **Design Thinking**, featuring a fully asynchronous eLearning course alongside supporting materials developed throughout the **ADDIE instructional design process**. It is intended to serve as both a learning experience for end users and a complete showcase of the instructional design workflow behind the course.

The eLearning course introduces learners to a human-centered, iterative approach to problem-solving that emphasizes understanding user needs, challenging assumptions, and developing innovative solutions. The course walks through the five key phases of Design Thinking—**Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test**—and includes interactive content, practical tools, and real-world examples.

In addition to the course itself, this repository includes all content created across the ADDIE model, including analysis documents, design blueprints, development assets, implementation plans, and evaluation reports. These materials provide insight into the instructional design decisions that shaped the course.

This repository also features academic content from the creator’s **Bachelor of Design Studies program at West Virginia University (WVU)**. Included are design papers, frameworks, and project work that further explore the theory and practice of Design Thinking from an academic perspective.

Overall, this resource is ideal for learners seeking to build their knowledge of Design Thinking, instructional designers looking for a model project built with ADDIE, and professionals interested in the intersection of design, learning, and innovation.

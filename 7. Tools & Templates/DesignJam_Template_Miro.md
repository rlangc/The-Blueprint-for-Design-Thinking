## 🧰 Miro Board Setup Tips

## 📎 Suggested Board Zones

- `Challenge Canvas` – problem statement + HMW
- `Idea Cloud` – individual brainstorming
- `Cluster & Vote` – group prioritization
- `Prototype Frames` – wireframes or sketches
- `Feedback Wall` – peer review space
- `Reflection Corner` – lessons learned and next steps
